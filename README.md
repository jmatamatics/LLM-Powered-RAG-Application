# LLM Powered RAG Application
The app utilizes Streamlit, an open-source app framework, Langchain, the most popular LLM framework for context-aware models, and GPT-4. Let’s delve into its workings:

⏏ PDF Upload: Users can upload one or multiple PDF files, which are then processed and indexed into a vector store.

📖 Query Interface: Users enter queries, and the LLM retrieves information from the embedded PDFs to provide contextually relevant answers.

☑ Results Display: The app displays the direct answers generated by the RAG model and the relevant documents used to create them, adding a layer of transparency and trust to the AI’s responses. It also shows the chat history.
